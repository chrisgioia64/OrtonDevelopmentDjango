# OrtonDevelopmentDjango

As an intern, built a prototype of a company website (modeled after the original website at http://www.ortondevelopment.com/) that is data-driven (e.g. portfolio are now stored in a database).
Includes a new map feature showing all current and sold developments that leverages Google Maps API.

Hosted through heroku. See https://tranquil-retreat-26973.herokuapp.com/developments/
